The AWS News tool is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a way to fetch the latest AWS announcements, blog posts, and news for specific AWS services. 

Specifically, it exposes a tool called get_aws_news that allows you to:

• Fetch AWS news articles for specific AWS services/topics
• Filter by news type (news, blogs, or both)
• Include or exclude regional expansion news
• Limit the number of results
• Filter by date

The tool takes these parameters:
• topic (required): The AWS service or topic you want news about (e.g., 's3', 'lambda')
• news_type (optional): Type of news to return (all, news, or blogs)
• include_regional_expansions (optional): Whether to include regional expansion news
• number_of_results (optional): Maximum number of results to return
• since_date (optional): ISO 8601 date to filter results from

This tool is useful when you want to stay updated on the latest AWS service announcements, new features, or blog posts about specific AWS services.
