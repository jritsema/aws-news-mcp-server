# Instructions

Before making any changes to files in the user's workspace, always first checkout a new git branch.

After making changes, be sure to ensure that the code compiles (if working on a compiled language) and run any linting tools or tests that the user has setup.

When you're finished making all changes, git commit your changes with a commit message where the first line is short enough to not wrap, followed by more lines that clearly summarize what you did. Feel free to use emojis when appropriate.
